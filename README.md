# ST-GDN 
a hierarchically structured graph neural architecture which learns not only the local region-wise geographical dependencies, but also the spatial semantics from a global perspective.

flowdatacheck.py: for the temporal resolution.

attention.py: describe the self attention network and GAT.

dc_cell.py and diffusionconv.py: the basic diffusion convolution network.

ST-GDN-main.py: we adopt the total model to optimize the loss.
